/*
Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,
add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Example:
If the vector has [1, 2, 3]
the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]
as 123 + 1 = 124.

/*
Solution approach:

1. remove leading zeros
2. add 1 to the last index 
  if it is greater than 9 take carry and put val+1-10 in array
  else carry = 0
